# 2026 Winter Oat-Pea Trials (CU_ARS_2026_WOP)

This repository includes the setup, data collection and analysis of the 2026 winter oat trail. 
Data is collected and stored on T3-Oat.  


## Script
These files are listed in order of operation to starting with the setup the trail.

  1. **Preliminary excel**  Trial planning doc created in excel including <br> 
           accession list<br>
           plots per accession<br>
           T3 seedlots <br>
           field map <br>
           accession to add to T3<br>
           seedlots to add to T3<br>
  2. **WOP_2026_randomization.R**  Uses the accession_plan tab from WOP_2026_planning to generate the randomization
  3. **WOP_2026_bulk_packs.R**  Generates the bulk pack labels for each accession
  4. **WOP_2026_envelopes.R**  Generates the planting envelopes labels .csv
  5. **WOP_2026_randomization_to_T3.R**  Formats the randomization into T3 multi-trial upload 
  6. **WOP_2026_workplan**  Create general overview of tasks and time frame. 
  7. **WOP_2026_biomass_subplot_randomization**  Randomly assign biomass sampling to subplots

## Data 
The most important files, in order of use, generated by scripts listed above. 
 
 1. **WOP_2026_planning.xls** This is the initial planning document 
 2. **WOP_2026_randomization.csv**
 3. **WOP_2026_bulk_oat_packs.csv**  Table used to generate bulk pack labels (word mail merge)
 4. **WOP_envelopes.csv**  Table formatted for use on envelope printer to print planting envelopes
 5. **CU_ARS_2026_WOP_t3_upload.csv**  File for uploading trial to T3 
 6. **WOP_2026_work_plan**  Excel file with work plan
 7. **WOP_2026_PM3D_biomass_timepoints.csv** Biomass sampling timepoints  


## Output
 1. **WOP_2026_work_plan** Calendar with tasks
